## About The Project
Using machine learning methods to predict electric vehicle penetration in the automotive market
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35366-3
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been introduced as an alternative to gasoline and diesel cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, optimize fossil fuel use, and protect the environment. Forecasting the sale of EVs and their penetration into the automotive market has been a significant issue for governments, policymakers, and car manufacturers to plan the production of EVs, set proper policies, and provide sufficient energy and infrastructure. The main goal of this research is to apply Machine Learning (ML) methods to build an efficient prediction model to estimate the sale of all vehicles in the dataset, the share of EVs in each segment, and determine the main factors that influence the sales of each EV. The codes related to the article are presented in three steps.
